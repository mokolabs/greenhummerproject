<h1>Construction Diary</h1>

<p>The Hummer was constructed from steel tubing from an industrial supply place that deals with the
public. Also included were three broken old bicycles, Stephen's prototype tricycle and six bicycle
chains. The Hummer's metal frame was constructed in Johnie's backyard. He lives a fair distance from
downtown, close enough to ride the Hummer back from his place but far enough away from town that he has
a little shed to work in.</p>

<p>Once the metal platform was complete and rolling, Jarrod, Nate, and Stephen rode it back to town.
Stephen and Nate pedalled and Jarrod rode his regular bike to assist and to take these photos. The 5.6
mile trek went very smoothly.</p>

<p>The same day that the Hummer was brought to town, we went around a few squares for fun, resulting in
the now infamous crash (check out our video page).</p>

<p>On an earlier test drive with Johnie and Stephen, the Hummer met up with its first curb while the
riders were trying to turn around in an intersection. The minor crash bent the right front wheel some,
but it was still  decent enough that we had confidence in travelling downtown on the wheel. It made it to 
town fine. No problems at all.</p>

<p>Then, Stephen, and Jarrod rode the Hummer around a few squares while Nate and Patrick, who has a
video camara, followed behind. Everything went well until, trying to get around a square tighter, the
right wheel tacoed, the Hummer's front end seized and Stephen and Jarrod went for a ride over the
handlebars.</p>

<p>Fortunately, except for Stephen's shins, and the right wheel, nothing was damaged. The Hummer and
crew limped home for the day to watch the video over and over.</p>

<p>The old mansion that Stephen, Jarrod, Patrick and many other people live in has off-street parking
behind the house, and the lot behind is empty. The Hummer could be finished downtown.</p>

<p>Johnie, who works for a plumbing supply place, delivered 220 feet of 1" schedule 40 and a box of
fittings. The PVC frame was completed shortly.</p>

<p>The next step was getting the thin plywood for the sides. Guerry Lumber is only about a mile from the
yellow house, so Stephen went for the plywood with the Hummer. The pvc was removed, and the frame went
to the lumber yard. Seven sheets of Luan were strapped to the Hummer, with the help of about every
person who works there.</p>

<p>The Luan was cut, screwed to the pvc, and the windows cut out. Then, the Luan was removed, painted
yellow, and replaced. A thrown out old futon was attatched to the front as a faux grill, defining the
front of the vehicle but still letting riders see as much street as possible. Lights were next, cheap
auto lights run off of a car battery for nighttime use.</p>

<p>Scrap wood made up the platform inside for passengers and our cool car console from the trash, and
wood made a platform for the car battery in the front, a foot rest for passengers, and a little carge
space underneigth the seats.</p>

<p>Details were painted onto the Hummer, completing the look. Some stickers were applied, and the Hummer
was complete!</p>

table</p>
