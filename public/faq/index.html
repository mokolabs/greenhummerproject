<p>Frequently asked questions about the Green Hummer Project</p>

<div id="faq">


<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">What is an H2?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
The H2 is an over-sized, gaz-guzzling sport utility vehicle created by the GM Corporation. Also known as a &#8220;Hummer&#8221;, the H2 design is based on a vehicle that is widely used by the US Military (both in Afghanistan and Iraq). To see just how bad these vehicles are, visit <a href="http://hummer.com" target="_blank">hummer.com</a>.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">Why did you build the Green Hummer?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
H2s are the best example of extreme over-consumption in America right now. If they were used to their potential by most owners (i.e. towing large boats, horse trailers, exploring the surface of Mars, etc.), and not sitting in downtown traffic, perfectly clean, unscratched, and holding just a single occupant, they would be fine. Plus, they&#8217;re easy to duplicate in pvc and plywood.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">Why is the Green Hummer yellow? Shouldn't it be a green?!?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
For maximum recognition, we chose to paint the Green Hummer yellow. Yellow is the color most often used in H2 commercials, and many of the H2s in our neighborhood are yellow. Also, a yellow Green Hummer makes people stop and think about what &#8216;green&#8217; can mean.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">How heavy is the Green Hummer?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
About 200 pounds (or 91 kilograms).
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">How many people does it take to pedal the Green Hummer?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
Two people pedal the Green Hummer. One strong cyclist can move it around alright. Two people usually pedal, though, because it&#8217;s fun, easier, and more relaxing. Two pedallers can also move around a couple passengers, and the tandem steering and individual pedalling makes it easy for a new volunteer to drive. 
</p>
<p>
Having a couple extra people on regular bicycles helps out immensely. They can check upcoming intersections for traffic, answer people&#8217;s questions, give directions to lost tourists, document the trip and pass things out. Also, when there&#8217;s a large number of bikes around, the crew of the Green Hummer can rotate every couple miles, to give others a chance to drive, and to let the Hummer crew relax and get back on a regular bike!
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">Is it easy to pedal and drive?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
Well, not EASY to pedal, but not as hard as you might think. Imagine riding an old beach cruiser with a friend or two on the handlebars, but stable. It has all the disadvantages of driving a car in a walkable community. If you pass a turn, you have to go around the block, you can&#8217;t just turn around. A lack of parking is the main reason we don&#8217;t drive, so pedalling around to find a good parking spot is a very strange feeling. Its size also takes some getting used to, being a 7&#8217;-0&#8221; wide by 6&#8217;-5&#8221; tall by 15&#8217;-9&#8221; long bicycle. When you get out or in, you have to jog around it. You can&#8217;t get around horse carriages, tourist trolleys or slow drivers like you can on a bike, and going down some of Savannah&#8217;s narrow streets is a little tense. However, the ride is so fun and the response so positive that the disadvantages of driving a &#8216;car&#8217; downtown are outweighed.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">Why do you take up parking places?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
Before the Green Hummer was created, Stephen went to <a href="http://www.ci.savannah.ga.us/cityweb/webdatabase.nsf/parking" target="_blank">City of Savannah Parking Services</a> to see where the Green Hummer would have to park. They said that a bicycle that&#8217;s too large to fit on the sidewalk should be parked like a real car, and have the rights and responsibilities associated with one. We feed meters. It&#8217;s a pain to have to find a parking spot for a bike: that defeats the purpose of a bike in the city! But, by taking up parking spaces with our bike, we&#8217;re showing how much space a car uses and how little an ordinary bike uses.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">Do you need a license plate?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
No, only motor vehicles need a license plate.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">How can I get a ride?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
The only people allowed to ride on the Green Hummer are crew members and volunteers. You have to pedal first! Because of licensing, insurance, and just plain hassle, the Green Hummer will never give rides to the public for any compensation.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">Are you anti-military?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
No, not at all. We support the troops. In fact, we believe, as well as millions of others, that not driving a car is the very best way to support our troops by keeping us out of the Middle East. We also have no problem with the original military Hummer. They&#8217;re tough, utilitarian, and arguably the best vehicle that the US military can use for many tasks. The H2 is a different story.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">How many miles a gallon does it get? Ha ha ha. You must not care about high gas prices!</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
We have put a cycle computer on the H2, and have been keeping track of our milage. So far, we&#8217;ve run more than 124 miles without a drop of fuel. People will come up to us in our H2 and make a big deal about us not using gas, but will completely ignore the hundreds of regular cyclists and pedestrians in Savannah streets at the same time. Gas prices don&#8217;t matter to the millions of Americans who don&#8217;t drive daily, we&#8217;re just more visible than most.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">You have a Bush/Cheney 2004 bumper sticker on the back!</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
Yes, we do. It&#8217;s sarcasm.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">Are you art students?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
While many Green Hummer Project crew members are students (or graduates) of the <a href="http://scad.edu" target="_blank">Savannah College of Art and Design</a>, this is not a school project.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">When will the Green Hummer stop rolling?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
We will continue to ride it around town until:
</p>
<ol>
<li>It breaks and no one feels like fixing it.</li>
<li>It is impounded, destroyed, or similar.</li>
<li>Our society as a whole comes to its senses.</li>
</ol>
<p>
When the Green Hummer does stop rolling, the bicycle parts will be used on other bikes, the metal will be reused for other projects, and as much of the Green Hummer as possible will be recycled. There will be some waste, but if our project made people take some responsibility for their lifestyle, then it was completely worth it.
</p>



<!-- Question -->

<h2 class="faq">How can I get a Green Hummer Project t-shirt?</h2>



<!-- Answer -->

<p>
The only way to get a Green Hummer t-shirt is to ride with us for at least three rides around town. Riding is fun and great exercise, so why not join us?
