Crew: Patrick, Danyelle, Stephen, and Chiaw, Drew as film crew

Mileage: 2.7 miles

</p>
<p>
The day started at 12:00, with Chiaw and Drew filming some more for their documentary. Chiaw and Drew wanted to get some shots of the Green Hummer rolling past, so they started ahead in a car. They set up their cameras at Wright Square, and waited for the Green Hummer to catch up. 
</p>
<p>
After the Green Hummer rolled by, they packed up, to meet at Franklin Square. Since parking is hard to find, the Green Hummer had to wait for a few minutes on the square.
</p>
<p>
While waiting, the crew noticed a black H2 parked along the same square. The crew waited for the film crew to catch up, and moved up into a space right behind the H2. It was an especially good target for the project: perfectly clean, unscratched, shiny, chrome gas cap. Stephen got out, and placed a yellow GHP tag on the windshield, standard protocol for a Hummer sighting.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/uploads/h2andwindow.jpg" border="0" alt="image" name="image" width="520" height="390" /> 
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/uploads/hhih2.jpg" border="0" alt="image" name="image" width="520" height="390" /> 
</p>
<p>
As usual, the owner of the H2 had parked where he could watch it from his restaurant table, protecting it from vandal attacks. He came out of his restaurant, took the tag, wrinkled it up, called us freaks, and said we&#8217;d be hurt if we touched the Hummer again.
</p>
<p>
When the project started, there was concern that there would be confrontations like this. Unfortunately, after three months and over a hundred miles around downtown there had been no confrontations at all. The crew was soft. There were no quick comebacks, no witty responses. The next time that happens, the crew will certainly be more prepared.
</p>
<p>
The Hummer crew filmed some more, and moved along. The Hummer went down Broughton Street for a few blocks, and then down Bull. Chiaw and Drew got separated from the Green Hummer, and found a yellow H2 on Congress Street. The Green Hummer caught up, and Chiaw and Drew shot some more footage.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/uploads/rollbyyellowh2.jpg" border="0" alt="image" name="image" width="520" height="390" /> 
</p>
<p>
Back to City Market for some more footage of people&#8217;s responses to the project. Unlike the H2 owner, the rest of the people we talked to were very positive.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Drew and Chiaw had to get the cameras back, and he had parked on the other side of the square. Even though it&#8217;s just a minute&#8217;s walk, they got a ride on the Hummer to his car. The Green Hummer carried 5 people that day, 4 more than the usual urban H2! Chiaw and Drew took their cameras away. 
</p>
<p>
On the way home, the Green Hummer ran over a few curbs on a shortcut through the Civic Center, something that a real H2 is never seen doing. 
</p>

The end!

This has nothing to do with the ride. I just wanted to educate you on your doctrine or lack thereof. Typical liberals, always two truths to your stories.&nbsp; I found two contradicting &#8220;Green Beliefs&#8221; on your website. #1 Drain magagzine article:
</p>
<p>
 1. the irony of which lies in the government using the vehicles for military defense (which is perhaps the most unpatriotic act imaginable, as many are dying as a result of greed over oil)
</p>
<p>
 #2 Your FAQ Section:
</p>
<p>
 2. We also have no problem with the original military Hummer. They’re tough, utilitarian, and arguably the best vehicle that the US military can use for many tasks.
</p>
<p>
 So, which is it? Tell me, which one is the truth? You don&#8217;t even know; yet, you mock these drivers like your better than them. How can you be so self-righteous? You who has spent just as much on tuition to SCAD or even better, what daddy has spent. Yet, you contribute about as much as the Hummer has to society.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your time.

Hello Christina,
</p>
<p>
We do not have a problem with the original Hummer. If you need to drive over wreckage or rough terrain or through war zones, then maybe those Hummers are good to have. If there had been a car bombing in Savannah during the G8, those camo Hummers would surely have come in handy, and that&#8217;s fine.
</p>
<p>
However, the government IS using these vehicles for occupation of an oil rich Arab nation. That&#8217;s not the military vehicles&#8217; fault. You can place the blame on the government, or you can blame our car culture. Either case, the final responsibility lies on us, the people of this country.
</p>
<p>
Hummers -the military kind- are tools that perform a function.&nbsp; Military defense is a necessity. Securing oil-rich lands shouldn&#8217;t be. If every American used 40% of the gas they use today, we&#8217;d kick our dependence, and before long we&#8217;d have to send food to Saudi Arabia and Al Queda would be broke. The H2 is no help.
</p>
<p>
Also, the H2 is far from the military Hummer. It might be &#8216;tougher&#8217; than your average station wagon, but it does the same thing. 
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the comment, 
</p>

I don&#8217;t own a Hummer, But I would be pissed as well if you put a sticker on any of my Vehicles. Perhaps if you don&#8217;t want confrontation you should mess with peoples cars and or trucks.
