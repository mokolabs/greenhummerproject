Our first outing around the city! The Green Hummer was christened, and driven around town. This was the first time that many of the people who had heard about the Hummer saw it in person, and the serious rumors started. 
</p>
<p>
The Green Hummer was far from finished, but it was rolling and shaped like an H2. Stephen was anxious to see what people&#8217;s responses would be, so we rode to <a href="http://www.vinnievangogo.com/" target="_blank">Vinnie&#8217;s</a> (a popular Savannah pizza spot), parked it on Franklin Square, and talked to people, or watched them from a distance. The response was amazing!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The response noticeably changed by location and situation. Cruising past Vinnie&#8217;s later resulted in cheering; a fancy restaurant on the corner of Bull and Broughton got a few stares; there was random applause elsewhere in the city; and the best&#8212;some people trying their best not to notice us at all.
</p>
<p>
All cyclists and almost all pedestrians stopped to talk to us, waved, or just smiled a lot. Several drivers gave us thumbs up or waved. About one third of the people in larger SUVs waved (surprisingly), and the remaining two-thirds did their best to pretend that their WASN&#8217;T a life-size pedal powered H2 rolling down the street besides them. They would look, but only if they thought no one was watching. 
</p>
<p>
We met up with Will, a friend, and rode with him for a while. He found us a real H2 parked on Gaston Street in front of Forsyth Park, and we stopped in a nearby parking space so we could compare vehicles. Patrick took a comparison photo (see below) that we can use to add more accurate H2 details to the Green Hummer.

It was a successful day.
