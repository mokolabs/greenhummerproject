The Green Hummer went cruising! The night started with a trip to the grocery store, the natural environment for an H2. A couple of Brian&#8217;s friends were leaving the grocery store while Brian, Stephen, and Chiaw waited for the rest of the crew to get supplies for the night.
</p>
<p>
Brian&#8217;s friends didn&#8217;t really notice the Green Hummer in the parking lot, and thought that our Hummer was a real one from the corner of their eyes. We decided that we should lay off of the additions to the Green Hummer; we don&#8217;t actually want people to think that it&#8217;s a real vehicle!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Brian, Courtney, and Chiaw pedaled for the first time tonight. As usual, each new person got a chance to pedal the Green Hummer, first with an experienced driver. After a mile or two, the new drivers were allowed to ride by themselves. As unusual of a bike as the Green Hummer is, it&#8217;s fairly easy for newcomers to get the hang of.
</p>
<p>
The reaction of the Friday night croud was quite different than the usual responses. There were more drunk young suburban guys around, and less relaxed tourists. The ride was a little more confrontrational than we&#8217;re used to, but was a nice change from only curiousity. The weekend night rides will be a good way to reach a lot of new people, and to have a little fun &#8216;conversing&#8217; with our non-admirers. With the addition of the lights and a good battery system, the Green Hummer can now make plenty of weekend night rides. The crew was out in the streets for several hours with no real loss of power from the car battery, even though there are 18 lights hooked up to the system. 
</p>

Several real H2s were sharing the road tonight, including a stretched H2 on Franklin Square. The crew talked breifly to the man and women who had rented the thing. The man seemed disturbed by the Green Hummer. The crew was disturbed by the limo.

</p>
<p>
Extreme consumption and vanity aside, just moving the vehicle around a walking city would be incredibly dificult. Our H2 copy feels as wide as the streets around some of the squares, and hardly fits into a walking city. The limo version must be incapable of travelling entire sections of Savannah. Nice.

On the way home, the Green Hummer reached its first hundred miles! Reaching 100 was one of the goals for this ride. Brian and Courtney were the drivers at the time. The miles keep adding up!

Have y&#8217;all seen the article about the Green Hummer in the new online mag Drain?&nbsp; I was reading the Bill Dawers Savannah Morning News column and followed the link to drain and from there saw the Green Hummer writeup.

I am sure riding in the Hummer Limo is much safer and far more comfortable than the bike Hummer
