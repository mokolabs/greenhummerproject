Sunday was a calm evening for the Green Hummer. Chiaw and Fred met up with Stephen and Natalie at Headquarters later in the afternoon. The beginning of the ride consisted of some Hummer/bicycle maintenance. The Green Hummer needed one of its rear wheels replaced. The old wheel was grinding and not worth trying to repair. A better wheel (from a junked bicycle) was installed. No more grinding!
</p>
<p>
The chains of the Green Hummer were pretty rusted, also. The chains were oiled up, some other adjustments were made, and the Green Hummer was ready to roll. Fred&#8217;s bike needed some attention also, having sat for the summer while he was away. The oil and bicycle pump went to Fred next. Natalie&#8217;s and Chiaw&#8217;s bikes also got some love.
</p>
<p>
After all the bicycles were rolling smooth, the Green Hummer departed. The crew decided to leave the newly tuned bikes at Headquarters, and the Hummer team rode two on the Hummer, and two on Stephen&#8217;s rewelded Goodwill tandem. 
</p>
<p>
The ride around Sunday night was a simple route, first to the Mellow Mushroom for some dinner, then around City Market. Sunday was Fred&#8217;s first Hummer ride, so the first Hummer team was Stephen and Fred. Natalie and Chiaw rode the tandem. Later in the evening, Stephen and Natalie rode the Hummer, and Chiaw and Fred rode the tandem for the first time. After a little practice, they were rolling along.
</p>
<p>
The ride ended with a trip to the south end of Forsyth Park, and a break at the Sentient Bean. The Bean is close to Headquarters, so after everyone&#8217;s drinks were finished, it was a quick ride home.
