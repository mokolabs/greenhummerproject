The afternoon started with a little Hummer maintenance. The Green Hummer had rolled over eighty miles last weekend, and a little love was in order. Also, it was the Fourth of July weekend, and some extra decoration was needed. Natalie supplied the flags, and all of us put everything on.
</p>
<p>
A stars and stripes pinwheel that Natalie had on her bike went on to the front of the Hummer. Two American flags went on each front window, and three plastic bows were strapped to the grill and back. Natalie&#8217;s bike was upgraded with two American flags strapped to her baskets. Stephen&#8217;s tricycle also got a flag.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Once the Green Hummer was decorated, the crew took her out for a drive. Frank the Dog (formerly known as Easy the Dog) rode alongside Natalie on her bike. The Hummer cruised around city market for a few minutes, and continued across the city.
</p>
<p>
A real H2 was spotted on Congress Street, and the Green Hummer hadn&#8217;t been compared to a real one side by side since many of the latest changes had taken place: the top lights, some painting, etc. The Green Hummer parked in front of the real one. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
As we were comparing our H2s, the owners of the real one came by. At first they were concerned about us doing something negative to the photo. Natalie explained our project and that while we were protesting the use of H2s, we were doing so positively, and nothing negative would come of it. The owners said that they use their H2 to pull around their boat sometimes. We told them that we were concerned about the environment and our dependance on foreign oil.
</p>

</p>
<p>
The Green Hummer moved along. Stephen and Natalie pedaled the Hummer while Frank the dog sat pleasantly in the passenger seat. The crew rode down Bull Street to Brighter Day, a health food store, for lunch and water for Frank the dog. 
</p>
<p>
After lunch, the crew made their way back to City Market, looped around Franklin Square, and cruised leisurely back home.
</p>
<p>
The crew talked to many people this Sunday. We thought that the flags on the Green Hummer might be taken the wrong way by some. Fortunately, everyone we ran into had no problems with our display of the flag. 
</p>
<p>
The trip on Sunday had brought the mileage of the Green Hummer to 92.1 miles. One more good day and the Green Hummer Project will pass 100 miles!
