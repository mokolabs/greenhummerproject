Thanks to everyone who participated in the Green Hummer Project and enjoyed seeing us drive around downtown Savannah.
</p>
<p>
While we&#8217;re all sad to see the project come to an end, it was time. The G8 has long passed, most of the original crew has left Savannah for greener pastures, and the Green Hummer was on its last legs.
</p>
<p>
But unlike other obselete vehicles, the Green Hummer&#8217;s materials have been recycled as much as possible. There&#8217;s some of the Hummer&#8217;s steel in the Oxygen Fueled Car&#8217;s bike pivots. A lot of tubing went into a &#8216;centipede bike&#8217; Stephen created for a gallery opening. There&#8217;s some Hummer metal in a rolling base for a printing press next door to Stephen&#8217;s studio. The gears and some of the chain went into a tandem bike. The few good wheels left are rolling around on other bikes. The futon grill is used as a table top in Stephen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.haleytrikes.com" target="_blank">trike shop</a> for holding plywood panels during painting. The lights went to the owner of the Pedicab shop for the taxi bikes. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
A lot of the Hummer&#8217;s shell couldn&#8217;t be reused. The pvc skeleton was warped from heat, painted, drilled, and generally abused. It was cut down to fit into a couple trash bags. The wood panels were also cut up to take up less space in a landfill. They might have looked good hanging on people&#8217;s walls, but they&#8217;d just get thrown out eventually. The console was beat up, and the plywood &#8216;seats&#8217; were delaminating.
</p>
<p>
It was a sad day when the Green Hummer was disassembled. Fortunately, parts of the Green Hummer, as well as its spirit, will live on!

<p>
But don&#8217;t miss Stephen&#8217;s newest creation&#8230; the Oxygen Fueled Car.
</p>
<p>
Our perfect SUV has been replaced by the perfect car! This time, instead of a tandem bike the size of a real vehicle, we&#8217;ve made a real vehicle into a tandem bike.
</p>
<p>
The Oxygen Fueled Car has its own web site, <a href="http://www.o2fc.com" target="_blank">www.o2fc.com</a>. We have photos, video, and links to panoramic photos of the car as well as a &#8216;how-to&#8217; page and other extras.
