<p>
Another day of the Green Hummer crew making up a large percentage of protesters. 
</p>
<p>
The day started out a little depressing. The protests that had been expected hadn&#8217;t materialized. The Green Hummer is not a G8-specific protest, but it would have been nice if there had been at least as many people in town as on a regular week. Pretty depressing.
</p>
<p>
Question: how do you pack three bicycles, three riders, and luggage for three people into a small, compact car? Answer: we don&#8217;t know. But we did it when we helped Matt, Kathryn, and Shauna pack up for their trip to Charleston.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/uploads/lack2.jpg" border="0" alt="image" name="image" width="520" height="390" />
</p>
<p>
The crew then rode regular bikes to lunch, taking up the whole road simply because we could. We had several security people ask us where our Hummer was. We obviously weren&#8217;t going to attract any new followers this morning.
</p>
<p>
At 4:00 pm, Mark and Ryan came into Green Hummer HQ with good news. A photo of our trip through the parade route was on CNN.com&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cnn.com/world" target="_blank">World News</a> page, under a link called, &#8216;Protests smaller than expected&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/uploads/lack7.jpg" border="0" alt="image" name="image" width="520" height="380" />
</p>
<p>
It was re-energizing news. The Hummer left with Stephen, Jarrod, and Mark to pick up Danyelle from work again.
</p>
<p>
The Hummer kept attracting other people again, and before long we had a record number of crew following along. However, the dullness of the city quickly drained the little energy that we had, and the Hummer eventually went home. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
On the way back, the former top speed record for the Green Hummer (14 mph) was shattered by Mark and Jarrod, who reached a PVC-shaking 14.8 mph!

Seriously, you people gotta get a god damn life.&nbsp; It is not the hummer thats polluting our society, nor the emmission gasolines, it is YOU, the green alien hippies from Mars.&nbsp; The only positive thing I can think of what you&#8217;ve accomplished is that 200 bucks which you contributed to the economy when building that piece of crap.

It&#8217;s hard to respect an opinion expressed by someone who isn&#8217;t intelligent or careful enough to use proper grammar and spelling.&nbsp; The Green Hummer rules! I love it.
</p>
<p>
I do my part by riding to work.&nbsp; I wish more people cared enough about the environment, terrorism, and their own health and happiness to do the same.

Hey, that&#8217;s a super machine you got there.&nbsp; In a week you would save enough money by not gassing up a real Hummer to buy a 1/2 keg of beer.&nbsp; A 1/2 keg, incidentally, weights roughly 170 lbs.&nbsp; You could cart it around in your Greenhummer and still have capacity left over for a couple of lightweight passengers to operate the tap!

Yeah and another advantage is, that you&#8217;re still allowed to drive, after drinking the beer- officially it&#8217;s still a bike!

You aren&#8217;t &#8220;saving the planet&#8221; you aren&#8217;t even spreading awareness.&nbsp; Everyone is aware that vehicles like the Hummer consume a great deal of resources and produce a great deal with emissions.&nbsp; You aren&#8217;t educating anyone.&nbsp; You are preaching to the choir.
</p>
<p>
You are a bunch of attention whores.

If everybody knows that SUVs are so petrol consuming, why are then still people buying them?!?!?!
<br />
And why is the number of 4wheeldrives increasing??? and I dont think that anybody suggested that they are educating. They are just drawing attention to it, that those stupid SUV owners get theiir little brains better working.
<br />
Thanx for ur compliments
