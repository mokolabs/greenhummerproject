Disturbed that the Green Hummer and its support bikes had been vandalized, Stephen switched a day at work to repair the Green Hummer as soon as possible. The trike had to get other wheels from another trike, and it was rolling around early in the morining. Stephen left the house for Johnie&#8217;s place, and started welding.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Stephen built two new supports for the sides of the Hummer shell, and two new peices to help hold up the back. It was something that would have been done sooner or later, anyway, because the Green Hummer&#8217;s been sagging, but the extreme bends needed to be fixed right away. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
The welder and its related tools went into the front of the trike, and back home. Stephen set up the welder in the back yard of the house, and started rewelding. Soon, the Green Hummer was sitting as tall as it ever had!

Unfortunately, not eveyone in this country wants to make their opinion known without violence or destruction of others&#8217; property. If someone has a problem with the Green Hummer Project, they should talk to us. We don&#8217;t keep an eye on the Hummer at all times like real Hummer owners often do, and we don&#8217;t want to. But we&#8217;re usually close by, and usually pretty easy to spot. 
</p>
<p>
Oh well, the Green Hummer was better than it&#8217;s been in a long time, just 24 hours after that bad Sunday night. It&#8217;ll take more than that to stop the Green Hummer!

Sorry to hear about the abuse that the GH has taken lately. It sounds like the repairs went well though.&nbsp; Maybe you should have ordered the $1999 alarm system option when you got you Hummer. :o).&nbsp; Keep up the good work!
