<p>
This Christmas, I&#8217;m sure all of you noticed the abundance of Hummer merchandise available for your holiday consumption. Undoubtedly, most Green Hummer Project supporters avoided this cross-commercialization like the plague, but us Green Hummer crew members were in a good position to receive Hummer gag gifts this year. In fact, Stephen received a Hummer flashlight from his parents for Christmas. Not only a good joke, it&#8217;s actually very practical! This useful but Hummer-ized gift was the inspiration for this catalog of H2-related Christmas gifts.
</p>
<p>
<em>Products are rated on a scale of 1-5. First category: Hummer TM worthiness- the item&#8217;s relation to the Hummer aesthetic. Actual coolness- Whether or not a reasonable person would actually find the product desirable.</em>

<strong><h3>Hummer cologne</h3>
<br />
Hummer <em>TM</em> worthiness: 3
<br />
Actual coolness: 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hummer cologne. For the man who spent $60,000 on a vehicle to impress women, only to find out he needs more! This gets good marks for Hummer <em>TM</em> worthiness, simply by falling in line with the rest of the Hummer brand marketing strategy. Like the flash bicycle or a Hummer shirt, the Hummer cologne says, “I’m manly and rugged, yet refined and sophisticated. Don’t let the pale skin and beer belly fool you”.
</p>
<p>
Actual coolness suffers greatly because of said marketing ploy. Also, a Hummer <em>TM</em> brand cologne supports the stereotype that environmentally responsible citizens smell bad. GHP alternative suggestion: Work on the beer belly first.
<br />

<strong><h3>Hummer Flashlight</h3>
<br />
Hummer <em>TM</em> worthiness: 0
<br />
Actual coolness: 4</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Hummer flashlight uses no conventional batteries, is waterproof, and floats. It creates illumination from shaking an internal dynamo: a magnet passes through a metal coil, charging a battery that powers a white led. It works as advertised, is handy, is thoughtfully designed and of good quality. In fact, it doesn&#8217;t seem to share any characteristics with the Hummer brand. A real Hummer flashlight would take three of those big, square batteries, only shine in the eyes of small-car drivers, and be too large to fit in a drawer. This product&#8217;s usefulness, good design and environmental responsibility make it inappropriate for the Hummer <em>TM</em>. These qualities reduce the Hummer <em>TM</em> worthiness to 1; it&#8217;s insistence of actual physical activity from its owner just to light is completely unacceptable.

<strong><h3>Hummer Mountain Bicycle</h3>
<br />
Hummer <em>TM</em> worthiness: 3
<br />
Actual coolness: 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
Actually a dressed-up Montague mountain bike, the Hummer bike features 24 speeds, quick-release alloy wheels, front suspension, and a folding aluminum frame. It gets a good grade on Hummer <em>TM</em> worthiness with its overdone off-road capabilities and small chance of being used to its full potential. It &#8220;transverses terrain silently at high speeds, with no thermal or acoustic radar signature&#8221;. I think that means that it casts its shadow <em>towards</em> the sun. No score higher than three, though; it lacks multiple cup-holders, it’s audio-video unfriendly, and has a relatively small size, even for a bicycle. It folds, for goodness’ sake! It’s like an H2 that compacts for easier parking.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
As far as actual coolness, there’s mixed feelings from the GHP crew. Yes, it is a bicycle, but a bicycle not well suited for use downtown. QR wheels? Flashy yellow paint? Super-knobby tires? A good bike to lock your scratched-up beater cruiser next to. A Hummer cyclist would have to baby-sit their bike as much as an H2 driver does their showy vehicle. A Hummer bike would best be used as jewelry on your Hummer Accessoriez <em>TM</em> Roof Rax <em>TM</em> or Bichin Hitch <em>TM</em> CliffHangers <em>TM</em>, with optional windbreakerz <em>TM</em> windscreen, but not for a ride around town. Maybe for these barren wasted landscapes that Hummers cruise around in all the time. A better option? An old Trek from a bike auction with the name scratched off.
</p>
<p>
<em>I’m sure that there are people who bash their Hummer bikes all day on some mountain somewhere, and ride it home. You two rock.</em>

<strong><h3>H2 kid’s car</h3>
<br />
Hummer <em>TM</em> worthiness: 4
<br />
Actual coolness: 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
Probably the most Hummer <em>TM</em> worthy of any product this year. It’s gaudy, boxy, and carries a maximum of two juveniles. It has a range of 1/2 hour per charge, just like its parent vehicle. It’s plastic, cheaply built, and motorized, to give your child a leg up on childhood obesity! 
</p>
<p>
I had a pedal-powered tractor as a child. Using the limitless energy of children to move more than their own weight in cast iron on solid rubber wheels inefficiently: genius! Now, an electric car for aggressive fun and some Ritalin later!
</p>
<p>
Actual coolness suffers because of the early fetishization of consumption. Also uncool: its apparent lack of long-term usefulness. While the pedal tractor I had was a hand-me-down, and my family still has it somewhere, the H2 kid’s car will be taking up landfill space while its parent is still a rattling ghetto-cruiser in the neighborhoods current owners avoid. GHP-approved alternative: a plywood shell on an old pedal tractor.

<strong><h3>Hummer bank</h3>
<br />
Hummer <em>TM</em> worthiness: 3
<br />
Actual coolness: 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
This little toy has a few Hummer <em>TM</em> worthy qualities. The most obvious: it&#8217;s a box that you just pour money into, even if just just childrens&#8217; change, not gas money. It has the Hummer <em>TM</em> worthy goal of relating money directly to flash transportation in still-forming brains. It also fulfills a Hummer marketing goal of making the Hummer feel like a good investment. Actual coolness factor is relatively high because of its half-hearted attempt to teach children to save, and the fact that you can get all of your money back out of the engine compartment. Wishful thinking.
