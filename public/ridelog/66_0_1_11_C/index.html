<h1 class="ridelog">Friday night with a small crew</h1>

<div class="date">July 31, 2004 / Saturday</div>

<div class="stats"><p>
Crew: Chiaw, Stephen; appearances by Johnie, Renee, Natalie, and Frank the dog
<br />
Mileage: 2.7 miles
</p></div>

<p>
The day started with a short interview of Stephen by Chiaw and Drew. They are going to make a documentary of the Green Hummer for a class project. After the interview, Stephen and Chiaw went out to dinner with the Green Hummer.

City Market was crowded, and the wait at the usual pizza place was long. We decided to instead try to get hamburgers from the lady in the empty lot on Congress Street that we had spoken to earlier in the month. Unfortunately, still not cooking! She said that she probably won&#8217;t be grilling for a while. We heard that she&#8217;s looking for a space for a restaurant. We at the Green Hummer Project wish her the best of luck!
</p>
<p>
Chiaw and Stephen continued on, deciding to stop by the Mellow Mushroom. While we were there, Johnie and Renee stopped by. 
</p>
<p>
After dinner, and talking to a family outside the restaurant, the two-person crew rolled back to Headquarters. While on Bull Street, we saw Tana, and Jaqui with her dogs. We stopped for a while, talking with a security guard that came from across the street. 
</p>
<p>
While stopped, Natalie, on a bike ride with her dog Frank, came by. 
</p>
<p>
After visiting for a while, the Green Hummer started home. On the way by Forsyth Park, a police officer pulled up behind the Hummer. The crew wasn&#8217;t in trouble, just teased! The Hummer was locked to a light pole and everyone went on with their Friday night.

This is fabulous.&nbsp; I am so thrilled to be a citizen of Savannah, and the know that this is a project in my city.&nbsp; What a great achievement!!!&nbsp; Maybe eventually we&#8217;ll even get Savannah to recycle.&nbsp; Until then&#8230; keep doing what you&#8217;re doing!
