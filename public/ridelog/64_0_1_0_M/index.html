The Green Hummer cruised around again this weekend! 
</p>
<p>
The night started with a trip to an opening at SCAD&#8217;s <a href="http://www.scad.edu/scadexhibitions/galleries/savannah/" target="_blank">Orleans Hall Gallery</a>. Since Natalie, one of our crew members, is a curator there, we stopped by to pick her up. Also, the Green Hummer crew really likes those cream puffs that seem to show up at gallery openings in Savannah.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
After the opening, the Hummer rode back to headquarters to pick up its car battery, so we could have lights for tonight&#8217;s ride. Once loaded up, it was back to the center of town.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Once in City Market, the crew decided to get some real food. Cream puffs only go so far.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The Green Hummer rode into an empty lot which is converted to a parking lot/barbeque stand on weekends. The lady that runs the stand said she was wondering when we would stop in. She posed for our photograph to show her support for the GHP. Unfortunately, she wasn&#8217;t cooking tonight! So the Hummer crew, which was very hungry by this team, had to move on.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Off to Parkers Market to get some food. The Green Hummer is now banned from Parkers&#8217; limited parking (which is a bit silly), so we had to find an on-street parking spot. Funny a gas station would have a problem with a pedal powered car. The rest of the crew locked their various bicycles to the rack and got some food.
</p>

</p>
<p>
The crew inadvertently split up at Parkers, so the Green Hummer cruising back to City Market for a while and the rest of the team headed back to GHP HQ. Until next weekend&#8230;

USA: khammery took over the streets
<br />
Good to grant to first yearly G -8 Awards Show Spectacular! It lasted whole week, and if to you it happened at this time to prove to be in the center of city, you had to focus attention on the military extra-roads builder, which patrol streets.

Yes, in spite of their nonurban destination Hummer it was possible to see everywhere. This was the part of action Green Hummer, conducted by ecological association. One of the purposes of this mass appearance of these burglars on the streets - this to force to think each above the fact, such as loss it will cause to city, if without a moment&#8217;s hesitation it will expend 26 liters of fuel on 100 km. 
</p>
<p>
One of the measures Green Hummer - the crafty construction of brilliant yellow color, which is the combination of several steel twigs, spare parts from three bicycles, plywood and PVKH, which it had to force people &#8220;to see that controlled with the aid of pedals Hummer H2 full size, that rolls itself around the real city, and to think about the contrast meanwhile that they advertise, and by reality&#8221;, to speak on vebsayte greenhummerproject.org. 
</p>
<p>
During the action its organizers attracted attention of the local masses -media of the mansions of the gudyashchikh horns and by the infinite crowd of noisy passer-by.
