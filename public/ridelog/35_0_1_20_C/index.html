<p>
The day started at about 1:00 pm, with plans for a relatively leisurely cruise through the city, and lunch.
</p>
<p>
But moments away from Green Hummer HQ, tragedy hit when we noticed our front left wheel was really wobbly.
</p>
<p>
So, after spending thirty minutes repairing the wheel (and fixing some loose PVC couplings), the crew went to Vinnie&#8217;s Pizza again, a treat since <a href="http://savannah.snitch.com/2004/06/08/bombthreat" target="_blank">they were closed</a> during the G8 blahness.
</p>

</p>
<p>
After lunch, the crew ran into a Hummer H2 owner at Parker&#8217;s Market. He noticed us; we noticed his Hummer shirt (not green). He was friendly and had a very good attitude towards our project. He told us that the main reason he had an H2 was the tax break for small business owners, and that if we had any problems with our H2, he would tow us out of trouble. A very nice offer! However, if we did get stuck in the muddy streets of downtown, we would probably just pick the thing up.
</p>
<p>
Saturday was a hot day, so ice cream of some kind was inevitable. But instead of hitting the ice cream and candy shops in Savannah&#8217;s Historic District, we decided to do something new.
</p>
<p>
We rode the Hummer over to M.L.K. Jr. Boulevard&#8212;on the edge of the Historic District&#8212;where the liveliness of the predominantly black neighborhood of the past has been &#8216;renewed&#8217; with fast-food chains, an expressway overpass, and empty lots.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
It was time for the Green Hummer to attempt its next challenge: the drive-thru window. So, we turned on to &#8220;MLK&#8221;, rode for a block or so, and then pulled into the nearest Wendy&#8217;s. It was just like the real thing. We drove up. We ordered. We paid. And we got our food. (When it&#8217;s 95 degrees outside, Frosties really hit the spot!)
</p>
<p>

</p>

</p>
<p>
Not as good as the regular ice cream shops, but the adventure of crossing &#8220;MLK&#8221; and <a href="/video/drive_thru.mov">going through a fast food drive-thru</a> almost made up for it.

Hi Guys,
</p>
<p>
My name is Michelle and my husband Al and I were the couple that ran into you at the market.
</p>
<p>
Great web site! I told you we would look you up.
</p>
<p>
Even though we are H2 owners, we think what you are doing and the message you are trying to relay to the public is great.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with your project and keep pedaling.
</p>
