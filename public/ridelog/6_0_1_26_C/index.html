A very strange day! The City of Savannah, in preparation for the G8, has military flyovers, camo Humvees through the streets, police all over, and baracades going up around important buildings. A rough guess would put 200 security people downtown, and the seven of us were the entire protester population. We hung out with the military all day.
</p>
<p>
We met at Green Hummer HQ around 11. The Green Hummer needed some details, and the early afternoon was spent giving it stenciling on its side and back. Renee printed the logo full size and adhered the paper to film she had left from a project of her own. Jarrod and Stephen cut out the letters and crew went to work.

While we were working on the Green Hummer, two G8 police stopped by to check it out. They were very friendly and polite, and asked the usual questions about steering and weight. Nate offered to take their photo with the Green Hummer, but they had to go and didn&#8217;t want proof of their stopping. (Johnie seems a little freaked out, doesn&#8217;t he?)
</p>

</p>
<p>
Off we went to Vinnie&#8217;s for lunch, getting the Green Hummer ready around 2:00. An AP photographer took some photos and followed us for a little while. 
</p>
<p>
Around Wright Square we passed a couple of aforementioned Humvees and several troops. As we were going back around the square, the troops told us to come back around. They asked us to park next to THEIR Hummers, and they took our photos. After a little awkwardness, we left.
</p>

Many of the crew members had to go to work, or back to Green Hummer HQ to finish the website. By the late afternoon, just Natalie and Stephen were driving, and put a few more miles on the Hummer. We were asked by another group of police about our intentions, with one cop the &#8216;bad cop&#8217; and four or so cops just telling us how cool it is.
</p>
<p>
A couple more laps around the city and the day was done, back to Headquarters to finish the website and other Hummer projects.
