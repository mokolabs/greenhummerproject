<h1>Volunteer</h1>

<p>The Green Hummer Project is seeking volunteers!</p>

<p><strong>Ride with the Green Hummer</strong><br />
The Green Hummer is pedaled by a <a href="crew.php">small crew</a> consisting of just two people. However, 
when the Green Hummer rides, we like to ride with a fleet of bike escorts.</p>

<p>We're currently seeking riders for both the upcoming G8 summit and also our popular weekend rides (both 
before and after the G8.)</p>

<p><em>Requirements:</em></p>

<ul class="volunteer">
<li>Live in or near the Savannah, GA area (visitors are welcome too)</li>
<li>Riding in Savannah heat is physically strenous; please be in good shape!</li>
<li>A working bike (10-speed, mountain bike, recumbent -- as long as it works!)</li>
<li>When riding, please bring lots of water. Suncreen is a good idea too.</li>
<li>If you plan to ride at night, you <em>must</em> have a bike light.
<li>Green Hummer Project t-shirt (provided by GHP)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additional Volunteer Opportunities</strong><br />
Riding bikes isn't your thing, but you still want to help? No problem! The Green Hummer Project also needs 
help updating its website, shooting photographs and videos, contacting press organizations, and other fun 
stuff.</p>
